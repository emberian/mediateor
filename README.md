# we hate each other but not that badly ☄️

*A trusted mediator. It doesn't judge — it makes the **shape** of a disagreement
legible to the people inside it, and keeps everyone honest about the few things
that must not be fudged.*

## The one honest idea

Most of a dispute is **not formalizable** — values that don't share a scale,
recognition, the fight under the fight ("you owe me $400" is usually "you checked
out on me for months"). That part stays the work of the LLM mediator and the
humans. We don't pretend a theorem prover can resolve it. The graveyard of this
field is full of systems that tried to formalize *everything* and died; the
survivors formalize a thin slice. **We formalize the thin slice and refuse the
rest, visibly.**

What the formal core *does* earn its keep on is narrow and real:

- **the ledger** — a calculator that cannot be lied to (not by a motivated
  roommate, not by a hallucinating model);
- **consistency** — whether two claims actually clash, or just use different words;
- **the crux** — collapsing a whole tangled fight onto the *one* contested
  question, and handing exactly that back to the humans;
- **fair division** — provably envy-free, equitable settlements over divisible stakes.

The core's real gift is **subtraction**: clear the parts only *masquerading* as
the dispute, so the real, smaller knot is visible and out in the open.

And the rule that makes it trustworthy: **model proposes, prover disposes.** The
LLM (and the council of diverse models) only ever *proposes* solver-checkable
artifacts; nothing is load-bearing until [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/)
certifies it. Sympathetic framing can't reach the verdict, because the council
evaluates the *normalized formal* form, never the prose. Every certified fact is
written to an append-only, hash-chained receipt ledger.

## A walk through the demo

`scenarios/roommate.json` — Robin is moving out; Sam holds the $1,200 deposit.
They're fighting over a carpet stain and some shared furniture, and they hate each
other, but not *that* badly. Mediateor:

1. **Certifies the ledger.** Itemized deductions are cleaning ($150) + carpet
   ($300) = **$450**. Sam's verbal claim of "$500" is *refuted by the host* — not
   by anyone's say-so. Refund is **$1,050** if the stain is ordinary wear,
   **$750** if it's chargeable damage.
2. **Isolates the crux.** From the lease, `tenant_owes_carpet ⟷ stain_is_damage`.
   The prover proves the entire carpet question reduces to one predicate — *is the
   stain damage or wear?* — and then **stops**. That's the human question. It is
   not the kernel's to decide, and the kernel says so.
3. **Dissolves a misunderstanding.** The "$500 vs $450" was a rough memory, not a
   lie — surfaced kindly, with a receipt, as a number to correct.
4. **Offers fair settlements.** Adjusted Winner splits the shared belongings into
   an envy-free, equitable allocation to accept, reject, or counter.

Robin and Sam never see a single formula. They see: *here's what you already
agree on (it's more than you think), here's the one real knot, and here are fair
options.* The verdict is never "you're wrong." It's *here is the smallest world
that holds you both.*

## The session — the AI actually mediating

The kernel is the trust spine; the **session** is the point. An impartial guide
with no stake in the outcome conducts a real mediation — and the certified facts
sit quietly underneath so it can't fudge a number, paper over a contradiction, or
be steered by whoever wrote the more sympathetic prompt. *The prover is the
stand-in for the professional who isn't in the room* — which is what lets a
community opt into this instead of a worse escalation, with no professional
present and a human always one button away.

- **`GET /session/:dispute`** — watch a full mediation, conducted end to end: the
  private caucuses (with the interest the mediator heard *under* each position),
  the shared ground, the one open question handed back, and the fair options.
- **`GET /talk/:dispute/:party`** — *talk to the mediator yourself.* Speak as one
  party; it listens and reflects in real back-and-forth (htmx). When you're ready,
  "see where this could land" surfaces the certified shared ground, the crux, and
  the fair options — tying the felt conversation to the trustworthy outcome.

On the deployed box the session is conducted **live by Claude Haiku 4.5** (Bedrock,
instance-role auth, no keys); offline it falls back to a deterministic scripted
voice so it always runs. The mediator writes the *human* part; it never invents a
fact or a settlement — those stay load-bearing from the prover.

## Architecture

The cathedral is **backstage**. Only the LLM walks its halls; the people in the
dispute receive the plain-language mass.

```
   UNTRUSTED                          TRUSTED
   ─────────                          ───────
   mediator-llm  ── proposes ──►   mediator-core ── generates .thy ──►  mediator-prover
   (Bedrock,                       (the reduction,                      (Isabelle/HOL —
    LM Studio,                      receipts, analysis)                  the only authority)
    council)     ◄── verdict ───   ◄──────────────────────────────────  Proved / Unknown / Error
                                          │
                                          ├──►  mediator-fairdiv   (Adjusted Winner + certificates)
                                          └──►  mediator-tui / -web (operator cockpit · kind party view)
```

It's **HOL-shaped, not Hets-shaped**: one host (Isabelle/HOL) with the few logics
we need shallow-embedded ([LogiKEy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370219301110)/Benzmüller
style) — the *alive* branch of this field — rather than many provers glued by
morphisms (the dead branch).

| crate | what it is |
|---|---|
| `mediator-types` | the frozen contract — pure data + trait seams |
| `mediator-core` | the brain: Formula→Isabelle codegen, the reduction, the hash-chained receipt ledger |
| `mediator-prover` | the trusted gate: drives `isabelle`, returns per-obligation `Proved`/`Unknown`/`Error` |
| `mediator-fairdiv` | Brams–Taylor Adjusted Winner + envy-free / equitable / Pareto certificates |
| `mediator-llm` | the untrusted operator + council (AWS Bedrock, LM Studio); degrades to a scripted operator offline |
| `mediator-tui` | two projections of one analysis, in the terminal (ratatui) |
| `mediator-web` | the same two faces as a simple, delightful htmx page (axum + maud) |
| `mediator-session` | **the AI actually mediating** — the session state machine + the mediator's voice (a deterministic scripted brain and a live Bedrock brain) |
| `mediator-demo` | the `mediator` binary — wires it all together on a scenario |
| `isabelle/` | `Keystone.thy` (the proven foundation stone) + `lib/` (the deontic + defeasible normative layer) |

Two front doors, both *kind*: a terminal TUI and a minimalist web page. Same
underlying analysis, two altitudes — the **party view** (warm, pared down, never a
morphism, never a verdict-as-judgment) and the **operator cockpit** (the full
graph, prover verdicts, and receipt chain, for the human supervisor + engineer
flying as a pair).

## Run it

Prerequisites: a Rust toolchain and Isabelle2025-2 (auto-located at
`~/isabelle/Isabelle2025-2.app`; override with `MEDIATEOR_ISABELLE`).

```sh
./run.sh          # build + cache + web + open browser — one command, that's it
```

Everything runs **offline and deterministically** by default — the LLM operator
falls back to a scripted formalizer so the demo never needs a network or an API
key. Point it at Bedrock / LM Studio to let live models drive the kernel.

Handy `just` targets (install: `cargo install just` or `brew install just`):

```sh
just demo         # CLI walkthrough on the roommate dispute
just tui          # same, in the interactive terminal app
just web          # web server only (expects caches; run just cache first)
just cache        # regenerate all analysis caches via the full Isabelle pipeline
just verify       # isabelle build -D isabelle + cargo test --workspace
```

See `DEMO.md` for a guided 60-second walkthrough of what to show and why it's
impressive.

## Disputes

Five worked disputes ship in `scenarios/` — each one runs through the real
Isabelle gate and ships with a precomputed analysis cache, so the web app opens
on all of them instantly.

| Scenario | The story | The one open question |
|---|---|---|
| `roommate` | Robin moves out; Sam holds the $1,200 deposit. A carpet stain and some shared furniture. | Is the stain chargeable damage, or ordinary wear? |
| `freelance` | Maya hired Theo for a $5,000 website; she says it's missing features, he says he delivered the spec. | Did the work meet the agreed spec? |
| `partnership` | Priya and Jordan wind down their studio; a one-year equity cliff and a contested departure date. | Did Jordan's departure breach the vesting agreement? |
| `separation` | Alex and Sam part ways over a shared-apartment deposit — wall scuffs and a cracked tile. | Is the damage attributable to Alex, or ordinary wear? |
| `siblings` | Two siblings divide a parent's estate; an $8,000 gift to one of them years ago. | Was that money an advance on the inheritance, or a gift? |

In every one: the ledger is certified by arithmetic, an over-claim is refuted,
and the whole money question is reduced to that single predicate — which the
kernel **hands back undecided**, because it's a human question, not a provable
one.

## Why this shape (the honest part)

In the lineage of [WMT](https://emberian.github.io/world-model-trajectories/):
the faithfulness of any formalization is a **seam**, and the only honest move is
to make it cheap and visible, not to hide it.

- The kernel guarantees consistency *of the formalization* and the certified
  ledger/division — **never** that it captured what you meant, and never that
  anyone is morally right. That stays yours.
- The prover may answer `Unknown` on hard goals. It is reported as `Unknown` —
  **never** silently treated as consistent. (The crux comes back `Unknown` *on
  purpose*: refusing to decide it is the honest answer.)
- Where a dispute resists formalization, the system **says so** and routes around
  it. The boundary of what can be formalized is itself a diagnosis: a fight that
  won't formalize is usually about values or recognition, not facts — and naming
  that is more useful than faking an answer.

No overclaim. The formal core is a supporting actor — maybe a fifth of the system
— and that is correct, not a disappointment.

## Lineage

Standing on: AGM belief revision (Alchourrón–Gärdenfors–Makinson), Dung
argumentation, defeasible deontic logic (Governatori), default-logic-for-statutes
([Catala](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03198)), shallow semantic embeddings in HOL
([LogiKEy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370219301110)),
fair division (Brams–Taylor Adjusted Winner, Family\_Winner), and the
"model proposes, prover disposes" pattern from the LLM-theorem-proving literature
(DSP, Baldur, COPRA). The contribution is the honest *composition*, and the seam
made cheap and visible. (Reading in `pdfs/`; design in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.)

## Status

Real and live. The keystone builds; the kernel certifies five disputes through
real Isabelle; and the **session** — the AI actually mediating, interactively and
live — runs end to end and is deployed (password-protected) for demo. Still young,
still honest about its edges, but the core of the vision works: a person can be
heard by an impartial guide with no stake in the outcome, and shown the fair,
checked shape of their disagreement.
